# AGROVISION – AI DRIVEN SOIL & VEGETATION ANALYSIS
AgroVision AI is an AI-powered land analysis platform designed to support
precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

The system analyzes images of land and soil to provide clear, visual, and data-driven insights into vegetation coverage and soil characteristics. This helps farmers, researchers, and decision-makers take informed actions without relying on time-consuming manual surveys.

# Vegetation Analysis
The vegetation analysis module estimates vegetation and non-vegetation coverage from land or satellite images.
It enables fast assessment of vegetation distribution and helps in monitoring crop health and land usage.

# Soil Detection
The soil detection module identifies and classifies soil types such as
Alluvial, Black, Clay, and Red Soil from images.
It provides the dominant soil type along with confidence and coverage information to assist in crop planning.
